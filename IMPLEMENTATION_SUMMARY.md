# Animal Adoption Contract System - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This implementation adds a comprehensive animal adoption contract system to the Documenso monorepo. The system addresses the problem of animal abuse after adoption by creating legal protections through civil liability mechanisms, as requested in the Korean problem statement.

## Problem Statement (Korean Context)

The system was designed to address the following issues in South Korea:
- Animals are legally classified as property with weak criminal penalties for abuse
- Need for civil liability mechanisms to deter abuse/neglect
- Stray animals (like street cats) have zero monetary value legally
- Need to prevent serial abusers from adopting multiple animals
- Verification needed to ensure animal welfare after adoption

## Implementation Architecture

### 1. Database Schema (`packages/prisma/schema.prisma`)

Added 5 new models to the Prisma schema:

#### `AnimalAdoptionContract`
Core model for adoption contracts with:
- Animal information (name, species, breed, age, description)
- Adoptor (giver) information with identity verification fields
- Adopter (receiver) information with identity verification fields
- Contract terms:
  - `ownershipRetentionYears`: 1-20 years (configurable)
  - `animalValuation`: Default ₩100,000,000 (₩100M)
  - `penaltyAmount`: Default ₩10,000,000 (₩10M)
- Consent flags:
  - Identity verification consent
  - Criminal record check consent
  - Visitation rights acceptance
- Status tracking (DRAFT → PENDING → ACTIVE → COMPLETED/DISPUTED)
- Optional link to Documenso Envelope for digital signing

#### `MonthlyPhotoVerification`
Tracks monthly photo submissions with:
- Photo URL and submission month
- Metadata validation (EXIF data as JSON)
- AI verification score for forgery detection
- Special verification flags:
  - `hasDatePaper`: Photo includes date written on paper
  - `hasHandGesture`: Photo includes specific hand gesture
- Review status and admin notes

#### `AdoptionDispute`
Tracks violations and disputes:
- Dispute types: ANIMAL_ABUSE, NEGLECT, ABANDONMENT, FALSE_INFORMATION, CONTRACT_VIOLATION, PHOTO_FRAUD
- Evidence URLs array for uploaded photos/documents
- Reporter and resolution tracking
- Action flags:
  - Animal recovered
  - Penalty applied
  - Contract terminated
  - Legal action taken

#### `AdopterHistory`
Aggregate history per adopter:
- Total adoptions and successful completions
- Active contract count
- Dispute history flag
- Admin notes
- Linked to specific contracts and users

#### `AdoptionContractTemplate`
Admin-managed templates:
- Default values for contract terms
- Custom clauses as JSON
- Default flag for system-wide template

### 2. New Application (`apps/animal-adoption`)

Created a standalone React Router v7 (Remix) application:

#### Package Configuration
- Reuses Documenso packages: `@documenso/prisma`, `@documenso/trpc`, `@documenso/ui`, `@documenso/auth`
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript with full type safety

#### Page Structure

1. **Home Page** (`/`)
   - Bilingual UI (Korean + English)
   - Feature overview with 6 cards:
     - Adoption Database
     - Special Contract Terms
     - Identity Verification
     - Monthly Photo Verification
     - Disputes & Reporting
     - Admin Templates
   - Call-to-action buttons

     - Section 2: Adoptor (Giver) Information
     - Section 3: Adopter (Receiver) Information
     - Section 4: Contract Terms (with interactive slider for retention period)
     - Section 5: Consent Checkboxes
   - All fields properly labeled in Korean
   - Validation and required field indicators
   - Legal warnings about fraud

3. **Placeholder Pages** (UI-only, ready for implementation):
   - `/contracts/:id` - View contract details

### 3. API Layer (`packages/trpc/server/animal-adoption-router`)

Created tRPC router with type-safe endpoints:

#### `createContract`
- **Input**: Full contract data (animal, adoptor, adopter, terms, consent)
- **Process**: 
  - Creates contract in DRAFT status
  - Automatically creates adopter history record
  - Links to authenticated user as adoptor
- **Output**: Contract ID, status, creation date

#### `getContract`
- **Input**: Contract ID
- **Process**:
  - Verifies user is adoptor or adopter
  - Fetches full contract details
  - Converts Decimal fields to strings for JSON
- **Output**: Complete contract data

#### `checkAdopterHistory`
- **Input**: Search term (name, phone, or email)
- **Process**:
  - Searches contracts from last 5 years
  - Aggregates statistics
  - Includes dispute information
- **Output**:
  - Total adoptions
  - Active contract count
  - Dispute count
  - Dispute history flag
  - List of contracts with details

#### Integration
- Added to main `appRouter` as `animalAdoption` namespace
- Uses existing authentication middleware
- Reuses Documenso's Prisma client

```bash
# Install dependencies (if not done)
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev -- --filter=@documenso/animal-adoption

# Or run all apps
npm run dev
```

### Environment Variables

Uses same `.env` as main Documenso app:
- `NEXT_PRIVATE_DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXT_PRIVATE_DIRECT_DATABASE_URL`
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`
- etc.

## Legal Framework

This system implements civil liability protections that work within Korean law:

### Key Legal Strategies

1. **Property Classification**
   - Since animals are legally property in Korea
   - High valuation (₩100M) creates significant value
   - Civil penalties much stronger than criminal

2. **Ownership Retention**
   - Adoptor retains legal title
   - Adopter has possession and care duties
   - Enables recovery without criminal proceedings

3. **Contract Fraud**
   - False information = fraud for ₩100M property
   - Criminal liability for lying
   - Stronger deterrent than animal abuse charges

4. **Visitation Rights**
   - Pre-agreed in contract
   - Enables monitoring
   - Violation = contract breach

5. **Evidence Collection**
   - Monthly photos create record
   - Metadata prevents fraud
   - Can be used in civil or criminal cases
